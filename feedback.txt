Time Series Forecasting:
MSC Dataset:
1) The head and tail of data are showing hour along with date even though it is daily data. It shows only date in the shared notebook.
    -> Fixed

2) The data info is not getting printed. It is shown in the shared notebook.
    -> Fixed

3) Dataset Description is going out of the GUI frame.
    -> Fixed

4) The plotly graphs shown in GUI are saturated compared to shown in the shared notebook.
    -> Graphs updated using a different function to render on gui now. Let me know if it looks 
    alright now.
    One reason for possible difference is that we are trying to fit the graphs in expander

5) The forecast dataframe is also showing hour along with date even though it is daily data. It shows only date in the shared notebook.
    -> Fixed

6) In HWES Training & Testing Split showing some data which is not required. Just a message that train-test split is completed is fine.
    -> Fixed

7) XGBoost is giving the error (ValueError) in Fitting Daily Data step.
    -> Fixed

APN Dataset:
1) Dataset Description is going out of the GUI frame
    ->Fixed
2) In CNN_Wavenets, printing of validation target reshaping is not required
    ->Fixed
3) The values in forecast dataframe and forecast plots for CNN_Wavenets are not correct. Appearing to be scaled values. The shared notabook has correct values.
    -> Fixed
Prediction:
1) In training and test split tab,a label 'Train Y labels' and a table with accessibility & retainability values is shown in the GUI. Not sure about this. I think this can be removed.
    -> Fixed
2) Overlapping of headers in join distribution plot in eCell_retainability data.
    -> Fixed
Anomaly Detection:
1) The heading of Outlier detection result are getting shown at the bottom of the cell instead of at the top.
    -> Fixed
2) The Classification report is not getting printed correctly in the test results.
    -> Fixed
